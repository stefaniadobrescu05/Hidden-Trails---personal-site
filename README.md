# A beautiful tale of ...

## Story

You have received from someone (your younger self?) a simple HTML only website with information about a specific topic, like a sport, city or hobby.
This website needs to be improved, with additional content, but, more importantly, with modern layouts, UI/UX practices and general styles.

For this homework you can either continue from the website you created for your first project, or start from scratch, with another topic of interest. For example, you can find an NGO that you like that does not have an website and create a website for them.

## What are you going to learn?

- How to plan a landing page.
- How to create a wireframe.
- How to implement a whole website.
- Use CSS to build responsive websites.
- Build layouts.

## General requirements

- Use only native HTML and CSS, no 3rd party stuff, nothing else.
- All pages should be responsive look good on multiple laptop screens.
- At least the homepage should be responsive and look good on both the desktop and mobile screens.
- Files should be organized according to their purpose, in separate folders.
- Proper git usage is REQUIRED. This means:
  - All code MUST be on the `main` branch of your repository.
  - Multiple commits should be created, referencing the issue they resolve, each with descriptive messages.
- Code MUST be formatted properly, according to the [prettier](https://prettier.io/) rules. You can use the [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for this. You can even enable [format on save](https://blog.yogeshchavan.dev/automatically-format-code-on-file-save-in-visual-studio-code-using-prettier) from it.

## Tasks

Navigate in GitHub to the _Issues_ section and complete all issues. Mark your progress by checking off the items. Issues need to be completed in ascending order (by number).

## Hints

- This project will be evaluated against four pillars:
    - _Visual style_. This includes how the application looks, how it responds to screen resolution changes, and how friendly and easy to use it is.
    - _Code correctness_. Is the code following the standards properly? Or is it just a mishmash of things put there until it works.
    - _Content_. The website itself need to have rich content, with pictures, text, and friendly navigation.
    - _Presentation_. How are you presenting the project? Can you emphasize all its features and show the code that you used to create them?
